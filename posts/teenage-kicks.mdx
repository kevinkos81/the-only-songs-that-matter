Influential BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel is known to have repeatedly stated "Teenage Kicks" to be his all-time favourite song, from 1978 until his death in 2004. When he first played the song on his show on 25 September, he played the song twice (something he had never previously done).[9] Peel also specifically requested sections of the lyrics of the song be engraved upon his tombstone
