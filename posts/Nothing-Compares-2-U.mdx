Yeah, Prince wrote it. Yeah, Sinead O’Connor owns it. Pile your descriptors: haunting, beautiful, aching, sorrowful, plaintive, powerful, cathartic, ad nauseum. You still can’t capture the titanic grace of this song. And this song is brutal for all its beauty: Newly gained freedom curdled with bitterness because it was unwanted. The video also adds to the legend of the song. Yeah, a lot of the editing dates the video. But when it’s just her filling the screen singing, it’s utterly captivating (Watch Nick Cave’s “Into My Arms” video from later in the decade and consider if it could exist without her video).
