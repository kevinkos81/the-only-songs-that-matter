I think about this song a lot. More than I should, really. Fuck an earworm, this is an aural
Mantra, a thesis statement breaking like a wave to the forefront of my awareness, all sturm und drang, then receding to the hum and drone of baseline consciousness. Why? Is it the “News of the World” sample looping like a great bird of prey to open the song? The specificity of detail that are hallmarks of Jason Williamson’s writing, e.g., Fred Perry Bollocks as sign and symbol of corrosive, late capitalist, consumer culture bullshit(of course, JW loves him some of the “right brands”)? The Grand Canyon-size chasm choked with flaking, rusted rubbish, and broken-down cars? Of course it is. But there’s one moment in this song from the early Sleaford Mods’ discography that sticks the knife and twists. Cheryl Cole, Gary Barlow, and Ashley form a grim triptych of third-tier losers who’ve hit the jackpot with the attention economy. In one compact verse, we’re offered the secret history of status-loss and sex for barter teetering at the edge of the same choked chasm. JW stretches the moment, will they spill over, will they survive before hitting the smoking glue punchline? They’re implicated; we’re implicated; we’re all victims, we just don’t know it yet.
